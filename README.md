What IS Greening the Spark?
Greening the Spark is about green electricity. And not so green electricity. It’s about how we generate, store and distribute electricity around the country and how we can control how much it costs and what impact it has on the environment.

Greening the Spark is a model of a system for electricity generation, distribution, storage and consumption – in short, a typical national grid. Originally started as a proof of concept and general purpose simulator, it is now being developed as a demonstrator for a hands-on museum exhibit. To clarify the scope of the project, here is a list of questions it is intended to answer and ones that it is not designed to answer:

Too fundamental:

What is electricity?
What is electricity used for?
What this project addresses:

Where does our electricity come from?
How does electricity get to where it’s needed?
How are electricity supply and demand matched?
How much of world energy consumption is electric?
How much electric power comes from each kind of source? 
What is green electricity and how green is it?
What are the relative costs of each type, both financially and in terms of environmental impact?
What types of electrical energy storage are there, how much is needed and what are their costs?
